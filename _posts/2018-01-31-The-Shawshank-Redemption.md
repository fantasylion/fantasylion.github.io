## The Shawshank Redemption

```
Mr.Dufresne, describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she wwas murdered.

It was very bitter.She said she was glad I knew that she hated all the sneaking around. 
And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.

What was your reponse?

I told her I would not grant one.

I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno. Those were your words, according to your neighbors.

If they say so. I really don't remember. I was upset.

What Happened after you argued with your wife?

She packed a bag. She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr.Quentin.

Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club whom you had discovered was your wife's lover. Did you follow
her?

I went to a few bars first. Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home. 
So I parked in the turnout and waited.[Some errors here]

With what intention?

I'm not sure. I was confused, drunk, I think mostly I wanted to scare them.

When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.

No, I was sobering up.

I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.

Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River. I've been very clear on this point.

Well I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning, and finds your wife in bed with her lover riddled
with 38-caliber bullets. Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

Yes it dose.

Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river before the murders took place. That's very convenient.

It's the truth.

The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found, so no comparison could be made between your
gun and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims. And that also is very convenient.
Isn's it, Mr,Dufresne?

Since I am innocent of this crime.I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was nerver found.

Ladied and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.[Lost some words] We have the accused at the scene of the crime.
We have footprints. Bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints. A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.
And most of all, We have a beautifull young woman and her lover lying dead in each other's arms. They had sinned.
But was their crime so great as to merit a death sentence? While you think about that,
think about this: A revoiver holds six bullets, not eight. I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.
That at least could be understood, if not condoned. NO! This was revenge of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature, 
Consider this: Four bullets per victim Not six shots fired, but eight. That means that he fired the gun empty
and then stopped to reload so that he could shoot each of them again. And extra bullet per lover right in the head.

You strike me as a particularly icy and remoreseless man, Mr.Dufresne. It chills my blood just to look at you.
By the power vested in me by the state of Maine. I hereby order you to sever two life sentences back-to-back
on for each of your victims. So be it!

Sit.

We see you've served 20 year of a life sentence?

Yes, sir.

Your feel you've been rehabilitated?

Yes sir. Absolutely, sir. I mean, I learned my lessson. I can honestly say that I'm a changed man. 
I'm no longer a danger to society. That's God's honest truth.

Hey red, How'd it go?

Same old shit, different day.

Yeah, I know how you feel.

I'm up for rejection next week.

Yeah, I got rejected last week.

It happens.

Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

Get out of my face, man! You're into me for five packs already.

Four!-Five!

There must be a con like me in every prison in America. I'm the guy who can get it for you. Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing... A bottle of brandy to celebrate your kids high school graduation. Damn near anything within reason.
Yes sir. I'm a regular sears an Roebuck.So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth
into the prison for him. I told him, "No problem"

Officers to main gate. Officers to main gate. Secure main gate.

Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.On the outside, 
he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank.Good work for a man so young.[Lost some words]

Hey Red.

You speak English, butt-steak? You follow this officer.

I never seen such a sorry-looking heap of maggot shit in all my life.

Hey, fish! Come over here!

Taking bets today, Red?

Smokers or coin? Bettor's choice.

Smokes. Put me down for tow.

All right, who's your horse?

That little sack of shit.

Eighth.He'll be first.-Bullshit! I'll take that action.

You're out some smokes, son.

If your're so smart, you call it.

I'll take the chubby fat-ass three.The fifth one. Put me down for a quarter deck.

Fresh fish today! We're reeling them in!

I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.
That was my first impression of the man.

What do you say?

That tall drink of water the silver spoon up his ass.

That guy?Never happen.

Ten cigarettes-That's a rich bet. Who's going to prove me wrong? Heywood?Jigger?Skeets?Floyd!Four brave souls.

Return to your cellblocks for evening count.All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.

Turn o the right! Eyes front.

This is Mr.Hadley. He's captain of the guards.I'm Mr.Norton, the warden. You are conviceted felons.That's why they've sent you to me.
Rule number one: No blasphemy, I'll not have the lord's name taken in vain in my prison. The other rules, you'll figure out as you go
along. Any questions?

When do we eat?

You eat when we say you eat. You shit when we say you shit, and piss when we say you piss. You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?
On your feet.

I believe in two things: Discipline and the Bible. Here, you'll receive both. Put your trust in the Lord. Your ass belongs to me.
Welcome to Shawshank.

Unhook them.
